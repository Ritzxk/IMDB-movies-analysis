### Inferences:

- The romance genre has been voted the least from the top 1000 voters
- Sci-Fi is the most popular amongst the top 1000 voters
- There is not a significant difference in popularity amongst Action, Thriller and Adventure, which makes sense also like these three, in general, goes hand in hand
- If we compare this bar-chart with that of the previous we can see that the top 1000 IMDb voters prefer Sci-Fi over Drama and also the dataset contains movies from 
  Drama more compared to other genres
- We can see that even if Sci-Fi has very few movies in the data set (as depicted in the previous count- bar chart). In general, they got the most number of votes from 
  Male, Female and also Top 1000 Imdb voters and also they have the highest rating across genders across their age group
